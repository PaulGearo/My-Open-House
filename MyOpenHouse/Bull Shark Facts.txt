Why is it called the bull shark? one of the reasons: the bull shark has a bad temper. It is known for being one of the most aggressive sharks.
It is territorial so if you mistakenly step into its territory, you’re dead meat.The bull shark can grow over 7 feet long.
Females average 7.8 feet long and weigh 285 pounds. The males are smaller,
growing up to around 7.3 feet long and weighing about 209 pounds.
Females are larger because they carry pups. Fun fact: As fierce as they are, bull sharks are not at the top of the food chain.
In the ocean, they can be preyed on. The predator gets distracted by the vomit and the bull shark gets a chance to escape. As disgusting as it is, it works.
