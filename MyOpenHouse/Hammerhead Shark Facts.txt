Why is it called a hammerhead?  so named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads,
which are flattened and laterally extended into a hammer shape. The great hammerhead shark is the largest species,
with the longest recorded reaching 20 feet long – that’s longer than most pickup trucks! It can also weigh over 1000 pounds.
On average, though, great hammerhead sharks are about 11 feet long and weigh around 500 pounds.
Fun fact: Hammerhead sharks have a 360-degree range of vision.
This means that they can see all around them at all times, whether in front of them, behind them, above them or below them,
which helps during hunting and also helps them get away from predators.
