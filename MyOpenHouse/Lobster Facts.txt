Depending on the species, lobsters vary in size from 0.8 to 3.25 feet in length. 
Most species are somewhere in between. Deep-sea lobsters are blind. Other species have compound eyes.
They cannot see clear image, but can detect movement even at night. 
Lobsters in the wild can survive up to 100 years. 
Huge percent of lobsters live much shorter because they end up in the fishing nets much earlier.
