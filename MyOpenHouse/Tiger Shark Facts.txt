So, why are they called tiger sharks? It’s because when a tiger shark is born, it has dark stripes on the upper side of its body.
The tiger shark is one of the largest sharks in the ocean. On average, it can grow 10 to 16 feet long and weigh around 800 to 1500 pounds,
about as heavy as a horse. Fun fact: tiger sharks ar known as the garbage can of the sea.
