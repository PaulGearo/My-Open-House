Puffer fish vary in size from one inch long pygmy puffer, to a two feet long freshwater giant puffer.
Main feature, common for all puffer fish, is ability to ingest huge amount of water, and air sometimes, 
which increases their body size and turn them into odd-looking ball-like creatures.
Quick transformation scares predators.Fun fact: Sharks are the only species immune to the puffer fish's toxin.
They can eat puffer fish without any negative consequences.
