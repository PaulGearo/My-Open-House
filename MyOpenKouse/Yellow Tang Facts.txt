An average grown up yellow tang fish varies between 7 inches and 8 inches in length.
Adult males are bigger in size than the adult females. Their width varies between 0.40 inches and 0.80 inches.
Most of the marine animals that wander about in the depth range of yellow tang’s habitat are supposed to be its predators.
Interestingly, orange tang is its most common predator.
These fishes outstretch the spikes on their tail fins while attacking their oppositions and as a defense mechanism against their predators."
