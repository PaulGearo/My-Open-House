Most clownfish are orange with three white bands on the head and body. The white bands are outlined in black.
Their bodies are a bit more than 3 inches (88 millimeters) long on average, but they may grow up to 4 inches.
Fun Fact: A clownfish is born male and has the ability to change into a female. This can happen when the dominant female dies,
the dominant male will turn into a female and then choose to mate with another male in the group.
